      "  Optical mice use an LED and a camera to rapidly capture images of the surface beneath the mouse.  The infomation from the camera is analyzed by a DSP (Digital Signal Processor) and used to detect imperfections in the underlying surface and determine motion. Some materials, such as glass, mirrors or other very shiny, uniform surfaces interfere with the ability of the DSP to accurately analyze the surface beneath the mouse.  \\nSince glass is transparent and very uniform, the mouse is unable to pick up enough imperfections in the underlying surface to determine motion.  Mirrored surfaces are also a problem, since they constantly reflect back the same image, causing the DSP not to recognize motion properly. When the system is unable to see surface changes associated with movement, the mouse will not work properly.  \n",

      "Error expanding contractions: string index out of range for text: Deatils on Kurdistan Workers Party?  The Kurdistan Workers Party (Kurdish: Partiya Karkerên Kurdistan or PKK), also known as KADEK and Kongra-Gel, is a militant organization, dedicated to creating an independent Kurdish state in a territory (sometimes referenced as Kurdistan) that consists of parts of southeastern Turkey, northeastern Iraq, northeastern Syria and northwestern Iran. Its current ideological foundation is revolutionary Marxism-Leninism and Kurdish nationalism. It is an ethnic secessionist organization using force and threat of force against both civilian and military targets for the purpose of achieving its political goal. The PKK is defined as a terrorist organisation internationally by a number of states and organisations. Also the Kurdish rebel leader of the group, Abdullah Öcalan, has declared his own guerrillas as \"murderers\".\\n\\nThe PKK emerged as an organization during the 1970s and developed into a formidable paramilitary organisation which rendered much of southeastern Turkey a war zone in the late 1980s and 1990s. Its actions have mainly taken place in Turkey and against Turkish targets in other countries, although it has on occasions co-operated with other Kurdish nationalist paramilitary groups in neighbouring states, such as Iraq and Iran. The PKK argued that its violence was justified by the need to defend Kurds in the context of what it saw as massive cultural suppression of Kurdish identity and cultural rights carried out by governments in the region. However, in its campaign, the PKK has been accused of atrocities against both Turkish and Kurdish civilians. Its actions, along with those of the Turkish state have been criticised by human rights groups such as Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch.\\n\\nThe degree of support for the PKK among Turkish Kurds is disputed. In some of the strongholds of Kurdish nationalism in the Tigris valley and mountainous regions on the Iranian border, PKK-linked parties have consistently polled close to or over 50% of votes cast in elections. However, PKK-linked parties have polled at most approximately one-third of the Kurdish vote (between 5% and 8% of the total Turkish vote), with the majority of Kurds voting for mainstream parties. In some of the more assimilated Kurdish areas, claimed by the PKK as part of 'Kurdistan', support for PKK-linked parties is at 10% or less. There is some electoral support for PKK-linked parties among Kurdish migrants in cities in Western and Southern Turkey such as Adana, Mersin and İzmir. \\n\\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PKK\n",

Its historical background goes back to 1950 BC, with many civilizations such as Hittites, Phyrigians, Lycians, Persians and Macedonians living here. The province is, worth visiting with its mausoleum of Seyh (Sheik) Edebali, who was an important influential person in the foundation of the Ottoman Empire. Nearby is the mausoleum of Orhan Gazi. Every September, a festival is held in his memory.\\n\\n30 kms from Bilecik is the little town Sogut which got its name from the numerous willows that surround the town. Sogut Is the place where the Ottoman Empire was founded and here there are the life size busts of famous figures of Turkish history. If you would like to see the whole of the history of Turkey before your eyes, then you should visit the Ethnographical Museum. There are many historical tombs and mosques in the province. Onyx handicrafts is recommended as a souvenir from Bilecik of which are great value. \\n\\nBilecik Province\\nFrom Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\\nJump to: navigation, search\\n\\nLocation of Bilecik ProvinceBilecik is a province in midwest Turkey, neighboring Bursa to the east, Kocaeli and Sakarya to the north, Bolu to the west, Eskişehir to the southeast and Kütahya to the south, spanning an area of 4,307 km². Population is 175,500 (1990).\\n\\nHistory\\nThe region was inhabited as early as 3000 BC, and was part of the territory controlled by such notable civilizations as the Hittites (1400-1200 BC), the Phrygians (1200-676 BC), Lydians (595-546 BC), Persians (546-334 BC), Romans (74-395 AD) and Byzantians (395 AD to late 13th century, with two brief occupations by Ummayads in between).
